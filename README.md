## Network Design Requirements
### Local Network 1
You are required to design a local STAR network connected via a switch to 3 PCs, 1 Server and 1 router
The PCs should use IPs 192.168.1.100, 192.168.1.101, 192.168.1.102
The Server should use the IP 192.168.1.10
The Router (or Gateway) should use the IP 192.168.1.1


### Local Network 2
You are required to design a local STAR network connected via a switch to 3 PCs, 1 Server and 1 router
The PCs should use IPs 192.168.10.100, 192.168.10.101, 192.168.10.102
The Server should use the IP 192.168.10.10
The Router (or Gateway) should use the IP 192.168.10.1


### Wide Area Network
Both the should be connected and be able to communicate with each other and allow any PC on either network to PING and other PC and any network 


### Exaanding the Local Area Networks
Setup DHCP on either (or both) servers so that the correct IP addresses are given to the appropriate PCs
Setup DNS on either (or both) servers so that Network 1 uses character names from the Simpsons (e.g. Homer, Marge, Bart, etc for devices)  and Network 2 uses charcter names from Family Guy (e.g. Peter, Lois, Stewie, Brian, etc for devices)

### Design and develop your Network
Design and test your network on design against the above requirements before starting
Implement your network in Packet Tracer
Document and Analysie your network against the expected results

### Comparing Protocols
DHCP, DNS, TCP, IP, UDP
